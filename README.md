# Bye Peng ðŸ‘‹

As engineers, we souldn't always resolve to using online farewell cards for our dear colleagues.

After all, it was those PRs, guild talks, Teams meetings and beers/cakes that make up our memories together.

So, why don't we code our own farewell card for a departing friend (i.e. _Peng_), one last time? ðŸ¤“

## Run the Farewell Card

Open [Bye-Peng.playground](./ByePeng/Bye-Peng.playground) in Xcode. Ececute the first line of code, you should see something like this:

<img src="./images/MainView.png" style="width:300px;"/>

### "Is that it?"

That is it - the template!

Our mission is to implement this farewell card our own way.

You can add your message, change styles and layout, add new views, or even put hidden message the way you like! ðŸ˜Š

## How to Contribute

Commit directly to the main branch. You can contribute in a few ways:

_Bottom line: Playground should not crash._

### Add your farewell message

Add your own farewell message to [messages.json](./ByePeng/Bye-Peng.playground/Resources/messages.json) 

Remember to:

- Adhere to the format set in the JSON file
- Run the [playground](./ByePeng/Bye-Peng.playground) after adding your message to make sure the program still runs.
    - If you hit an error, time to use your JSON debug skills ðŸ˜‰

### Change style and layout

All code is in [Message.swift](ByePeng/Bye-Peng.playground/Sources/Message.swift). 

Feel free to edit the source file to make the farewell card more stylish and, have fun!

### Put a hidden message somewhere

It is up to how creative you want to be in placing Easter eggs.

## Deadline

This repository will be closed on Peng's last day with us ðŸ˜¢

A copy of the end product will be sent to Peng for his memory.
